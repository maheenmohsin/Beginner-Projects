Project 1: Hello World + User Input Form
This is the very first beginner project in Python. It covers two fundamentals:

Printing output
Taking user input
Code
print("Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹")

name = input("What is your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")

print("Nice to meet you,", name + "! You are", age, "years old.")

Sample Output
Hello, World! 
What is your name? Maheen
How old are you? 20
Nice to meet you, Maheen! You are 20 years old.
