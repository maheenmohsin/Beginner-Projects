Project 1: Hello World + User Input Form

ðŸ‘‹ This is the first project in my Python Beginner Projects Series.
It introduces two fundamental concepts in Python programming:

Printing Output (using print())

Taking User Input (using input())

print("Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹")

name = input("What is your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")

print("Nice to meet you,", name + "! You are", age, "years old.")
print("Did you know? In 5 years, you will be", int(age) + 5, "years old! ðŸš€")
Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹
What is your name? Maheen
How old are you? 20
Nice to meet you, Maheem! You are 20 years old.
Did you know? In 5 years, you will be 25 years old! ðŸš€
